# DBMS Mini Project (Energy Monitoring System)

Description: A Python and MySQL project for tracking electrical equipment, operators, and energy consumption. Enables companies to manage equipment ownership, monitor energy usage, and generate alerts. Includes relational database schema, backend implemented in Python using Flask, and MySQL. Promotes efficient resource optimization and sustainability practices within organizations

(Work in progress ðŸ”¨ðŸ”ƒ)

## What's the plan?

- **Backend Framework** - Python (Flask) + MySQL

- **Database Connectivity**: `mysql-connector` or `pymysql` library in Python to connect to your MySQL database.

- **Database Schema Creation**: Tables are `Company`, `Equipments`, `Operators`, `Alerts` and `Operates`.

- **SQLAlchemy (Optional)**: Maybe using SQLAlchemy, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python, to interact with your database in a more Pythonic way.

- **RESTful API (Optional)**: RESTful API using Flask/Django to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, for a web or mobile frontend.

## To-do list:

-> install MySQL

-> create your database

->  configure your Python backend to connect to the MySQL database
